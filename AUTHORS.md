# **About the Author**

## **Daniel T. Sasser II**

Daniel T. Sasser II is a Cognitive Architect and the creator of the SIM-ONE Framework. With over two decades of experience in AI systems design and ethical AI governance, his work focuses on protocol-driven intelligence and the development of safe, efficient AGI.

### **Core Philosophy & Vision**

The Sim-One Framework was born out of a deep conviction that the current trajectory of AI development is fundamentally flawed. The race for brute-force scale has led us toward a future of powerful but chaotic, untrustworthy, and unsustainable systems. I believe that true intelligence is not a product of chaos, but of order. This project is my answer: an architecture built on a foundation of explicit laws and first principles, designed to bring structure, accountability, and a new standard of engineering elegance to the field of Artificial General Intelligence.
