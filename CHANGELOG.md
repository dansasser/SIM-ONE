## Version Numbering

SIM-ONE follows semantic versioning:
- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes or architectural overhauls
- **MINOR** version for new functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- **PATCH** version for backwards compatible bug fixes

## Categories

- **Added** for new features
- **Changed** for changes in existing functionality
- **Deprecated** for soon-to-be removed features
- **Removed** for now removed features
- **Fixed** for any bug fixes
- **Security** for vulnerability fixes
- **Enhanced** for improvements to existing features
- **Technical Improvements** for internal optimizations
- **Documentation** for documentation changes

## Five Laws Compliance

All changes must maintain compliance with the Five Laws of Cognitive Governance:

1. **Architectural Intelligence** - Intelligence through coordination, not complexity
2. **Cognitive Governance** - All processes governed by specialized protocols
3. **Truth Foundation** - Grounded in absolute truth principles
4. **Energy Stewardship** - Maximum intelligence with minimal resources
5. **Deterministic Reliability** - Consistent, predictable outcomes
