## [Unreleased]

### Added - Phase 22: Paper2Agent Integration (2025-01-10)

#### Naming Clarification & Migration Strategy
- **mcp_server Naming Clarification** - Added prominent notices in all READMEs explaining that `mcp_server` refers to SIM-ONE's "Multi-Protocol Cognitive Platform", not the industry-standard Model Context Protocol
- **Migration Plan** - Comprehensive 6-12 month roadmap for eventual `mcp_server` â†’ `agent_core` transition with full backward compatibility
- **Internal Transition Guide** - Developer documentation for gradual terminology updates in new code

#### Five Laws Governance Tools (Core Contribution)
- **Five Laws Evaluator Library** (`code/tools/lib/five_laws_evaluator.py`) - 500-line unified evaluation engine for validating any text against all Five Laws of Cognitive Governance
- **Five Laws Validator CLI** (`code/tools/run_five_laws_validator.py`) - 350-line command-line tool enabling Paper2Agent and other AI systems to self-govern their outputs
  - Supports `--text`, `--file`, and `stdin` input methods
  - Configurable strictness levels (lenient, moderate, strict)
  - Multiple output formats (JSON, compact, human-readable summary)
  - Comprehensive scoring for all five laws with actionable recommendations
  - Exit codes for automated pass/fail workflows

#### Protocol Tool Wrappers
- **REP Tool** (`code/tools/run_rep_tool.py`) - CLI wrapper for Reasoning & Explanation Protocol supporting deductive, inductive, abductive, analogical, and causal reasoning
- **ESL Tool** (`code/tools/run_esl_tool.py`) - CLI wrapper for Emotional State Layer Protocol with multi-dimensional emotion detection
- **VVP Tool** (`code/tools/run_vvp_tool.py`) - CLI wrapper for Validation & Verification Protocol for input validation

#### Tool Discovery Infrastructure
- **Tools Manifest** (`code/tools/tools_manifest.json`) - Comprehensive metadata file for Paper2Agent tool discovery including:
  - Tool categorization (governance, protocols, orchestration, workflows)
  - Input/output specifications and examples
  - Use cases and integration patterns
  - Composition guidelines for protocol chaining

#### Documentation
- **mcp_server Directory README** - Dedicated explanation of directory naming and migration timeline
- **Future Naming Guidelines** - Internal developer guide for transitional terminology
- **Implementation Plan** - Complete technical specification for Paper2Agent integration
- **Progress Report** - Detailed status tracking for Phase 22 work

### Use Cases Enabled
- **AI Self-Governance** - Paper2Agent and similar systems can now validate their own responses against the Five Laws before output
- **Multi-Agent Validation** - One agent can govern another's outputs using standardized SIM-ONE protocols
- **Governed Content Generation** - AI systems can generate responses with built-in Five Laws compliance checking
- **Protocol Composition** - Tools can be chained via pipes for complex governed workflows

### Technical Improvements
- **Zero Breaking Changes** - All additions are new files; existing functionality completely preserved
- **Backward Compatibility** - No modifications to existing imports, APIs, or configurations
- **Composable Architecture** - All tools support piping and can be chained together
- **Standard I/O Patterns** - Consistent CLI interface across all tool wrappers
- **Machine-Readable Output** - All tools default to JSON for easy parsing and automation

### Added - Semantic Encoding Protocol (Previous)
- **Semantic Encoding Protocol (SEP)** - Complete implementation of lightweight transformer-based semantic embeddings for enhanced RAG capabilities
- **Enhanced RAG Architecture** - Multi-tier RAG system with semantic understanding while maintaining MVLM purity
- **Intelligent Embedding Cache** - High-performance caching system with TTL, compression, and LRU eviction
- **Multi-Model Encoder Support** - Support for multiple encoder models with automatic fallback and optimization
- **Protocol Documentation** - Comprehensive SEP protocol documentation following SIM-ONE standards
- **Performance Monitoring** - Real-time statistics and efficiency scoring for encoding operations
- **Energy Stewardship Compliance** - 22-82MB models vs GB alternatives, maintaining Law 4 compliance

### Enhanced
- **Vector Search Engine** - Integration points prepared for SEP semantic embeddings
- **Memory Manager** - Enhanced semantic search capabilities with multi-factor scoring
- **RAG Manager** - Improved context retrieval quality and relevance through semantic understanding
- **Protocol Integration** - Seamless integration with existing Critic, Ideator, and Revisor protocols

### Technical Improvements
- **Batch Processing** - Efficient handling of multiple text encodings simultaneously
- **Quality Assessment** - Automatic validation of embedding quality with fallback mechanisms
- **Deterministic Behavior** - Consistent embeddings for identical inputs (Law 5 compliance)
- **Error Recovery** - Graceful degradation and comprehensive error handling
- **Model Optimization** - Automatic model selection based on performance metrics

### Documentation
