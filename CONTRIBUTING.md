# Contributing to the SIM‑ONE Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **SIM‑ONE Framework** — an open, principle‑driven architecture for **governed cognition**.

SIM‑ONE is not just another AI project. It’s a **new standard for architectural intelligence**, focused on deterministic reliability, truth‑grounded reasoning, and sustainable efficiency.  
We welcome contributions from individuals who share this vision and want to help shape the future of AI governance.

## 🤝 Who We’re Looking For

We are actively seeking **like‑minded contributors** in any of the following areas:

- **AI Governance & Cognitive Architecture**  
  Researchers, architects, and engineers interested in protocol‑driven cognition, alignment, and AI standards.

- **Machine Learning & Multi‑Agent Systems**  
  Developers and researchers with experience in LLM integration, agent orchestration, or scalable AI workflows.

- **Software Architecture & Systems Engineering**  
  Those who can help refine, implement, and extend the SIM‑ONE protocol stack in robust, maintainable ways.

- **Ethics, Philosophy & Policy**  
  Thinkers who can contribute to the ethical, philosophical, and policy frameworks that guide governed cognition.

- **Documentation & Technical Writing**  
  Writers who can help communicate SIM‑ONE's architecture and principles to a wider audience.

If you’re aligned with the **Five Laws of Cognitive Governance** in our [`MANIFESTO.md`](./MANIFESTO.md), we’d like to hear from you.

## 📜 Our Core Contribution Principles

1. **Alignment with the Manifesto**  
   Contributions must be consistent with the philosophical and architectural principles outlined in the SIM‑ONE Manifesto.

2. **IP Protection**
   Implementation details are available under the AGPL v3 license, with commercial licensing available for proprietary use.
   Contributions should align with the dual-license structure and maintain appropriate attribution.

3. **Collaboration with Integrity**  
   We value constructive dialogue, evidence‑based reasoning, and respectful collaboration.

4. **Sustainability & Efficiency**  
   We prioritize designs that minimize computational waste while maximizing governed intelligence.
