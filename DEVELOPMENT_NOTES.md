# SIM-ONE Framework Security Implementation - Development Notes

## Branch: genspark_ai_developer

**Created**: August 30, 2025
**Purpose**: Security hardening and production readiness implementation

## Current Analysis Summary

### Code vs Documentation Assessment
- **Status**: agents.md claims 75% production ready
- **Reality**: Most security features implemented but missing critical test suite
- **Gap**: Security tests referenced in agents.md don't exist in codebase

### Key Findings
✅ **Implemented Features**:
- RBAC system with admin/user/read-only roles
- Security headers middleware (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Advanced input validation
- Secure error handling with sanitization
- Hashed API key management system
- Configurable CORS via environment variables

❌ **Missing/Incomplete**:
- Security test suite (`mcp_server/tests/security/` directory)
- Containerization infrastructure
- Production deployment validation
- CI/CD pipeline

### Next Phase Implementation Plan
1. Create missing security test suite
2. Validate production server configuration
3. Implement containerization (Docker/docker-compose)
4. Set up automated CI/CD pipeline
