> **Project Purpose:** The Sim-One Framework provides a formal structure for building governed artificial intelligence, offering an alternative to current brute-force LLM models through modular orchestration and protocolic control.

This repository contains the official documentation for the Sim-One Framework, an open cognitive architecture designed to create trustworthy, efficient, and transparent AI systems. Built on the Five Laws of Cognitive Governance, this framework utilizes a modular system of agents—including a Planner, Verifier, and a specialized Minimum Viable Language Model (MVLM)—to move beyond brute-force scaling. This project provides a new, open standard for AGI development that prioritizes architectural elegance and auditable, protocol-driven intelligence.

## **1. Introduction: Redefining AGI Through Governed Intelligence with the SIM-ONE Framework**

The current race toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is accelerating, but it's doing so without guardrails. The dominant approach—brute-force scaling of large language models—has led to systems that are powerful but unpredictable, difficult to audit, and often ethically fragile.

The SIM-ONE Framework is designed to change this.

It introduces a new, architecture-first paradigm based on cognitive governance. By separating cognitive roles (planning, execution, verification, and ethical filtering) into distinct, auditable agents governed by machine-readable protocols, SIM-ONE offers a **structured, accountable, and open path to AGI**.

This repository serves as the canonical reference for this open cognitive architecture.

## **2. The Five Laws of Cognitive Governance**

The philosophical core of the Sim-One framework is a set of five non-negotiable laws that ensure a governed, stable, and coherent intelligence.

1.  **The Law of Structural Priority:** The framework must prioritize the integrity and logic of its own architecture above any single output it generates.
2.  **The Law of Recursive Validation:** The framework must verify its own outputs against its inputs, its internal plan, and its ethical principles before releasing them.
3.  **The Law of Ethical Alignment:** The framework must operate under a dedicated, non-overridable Ethical Control Protocol (ECP) that acts as a final gatekeeper.
4.  **The Law of Experiential Memory:** The framework must maintain a persistent, auditable log of its operations to learn from its experience and ensure accountability.
5.  **The Law of Protocolic Governance:** The framework must be governed by explicit, machine-readable protocols, not by ambiguous, emergent behaviors.

## **3. The Architecture in Action**

The Five Laws are not just a philosophy; they are implemented in a specific, transparent cognitive architecture.

### **Key Components:**

* **The Planner:** The entry point for any task. The Planner receives a user's goal, interprets it, and creates a detailed, structured plan for the Executor to follow. It is responsible for decomposing complex problems into actionable steps.
* **The Executor (MVLM):** The "engine" of the framework. The Executor is a Minimum Viable Language Model whose sole purpose is to execute the structured plan provided by the Planner, generating a draft output.
* **The Verifier:** The quality control agent. After the Executor produces a draft, the Verifier checks the output for accuracy and fidelity against the original plan from the Planner.
* **The ECP (Ethical Control Protocol):** A dedicated and non-overridable ethical gatekeeper. It runs in parallel with the Verifier, checking the Executor's draft output against a set of explicit ethical rules. An output cannot be released unless it passes the ECP.
* **The Audit Log:** A persistent and transparent record of every step, decision, and output generated by the framework. This ensures full accountability and traceability for the system's actions.

## **4. MVLM: A Minimalist Execution Engine for Efficient Cognitive Tasks**

A key innovation of the Sim-One framework is the concept of the MVLM. Instead of relying on a single, massive, all-purpose model, we advocate for a small, hyper-efficient language model designed specifically for execution, not general reasoning. By offloading the cognitive labor of planning and verification to other agents, the MVLM can remain lean, fast, and predictable, which is the key to the framework's overall efficiency and sustainability.
