**SIM‑ONE is the first open framework to formalize *governed cognition*, moving beyond brute‑force scaling to establish a principled, efficient, and reliable approach to AI architecture.**

This repository contains the official **MANIFESTO**, architectural philosophy, and guiding principles for the SIM‑ONE Framework.  
It is intentionally designed to be **transparent about the "why"** and **protective of the "how"**.

## Core Philosophy

The AI industry has been locked in a race to scale: larger models, more compute, endless parameter counts.  
The result? **Impressive capabilities — unpredictable behavior — unsustainable energy costs.**

**Capability without governance is not intelligence.**  
It’s volatility.

The SIM‑ONE Framework offers a **different path**:  
Architectural intelligence over computational brute force.  
Governed cognition over unrestrained generation.

## The MANIFESTO

The complete SIM‑ONE MANIFESTO is available in [`MANIFESTO.md`](./MANIFESTO.md).  
It outlines the philosophical and engineering basis for governed cognition.

## The Five Laws of Cognitive Governance

These laws define the non‑negotiable principles that guide the SIM‑ONE Framework:

1. **Architectural Intelligence** – Intelligence emerges from coordination and governance, not from model size or parameter count.  
2. **Cognitive Governance** – Every cognitive process must be governed by specialized protocols that ensure quality, reliability, and alignment.  
3. **Truth Foundation** – All reasoning must be grounded in absolute truth principles, not relativistic or probabilistic generation.  
4. **Energy Stewardship** – Achieve maximum intelligence with minimal computational resources through architectural efficiency.  
5. **Deterministic Reliability** – Governed systems must produce consistent, predictable outcomes rather than probabilistic variations.

These laws are **principles, not features**.  
They can be applied in any cognitive architecture — but SIM‑ONE was designed from the ground up to embody them.

## Architectural Overview

Without revealing implementation details, SIM‑ONE is:

- **Protocol‑Driven** – Intelligence emerges from the orchestration of specialized cognitive protocols.  
- **Multi‑Agent Capable** – Designed for coordinated roles that specialize, interact, and adapt.  
- **Energy‑Efficient** – Optimized for architectural efficiency, not parameter scaling.  
- **Truth‑Aligned** – Built to operate from a principled foundation.  
- **Deterministic** – Prioritizes reproducible, consistent reasoning over probabilistic novelty.

---

## Project Status

- **Philosophical Framework** – Complete  
- **Nine Governance Protocols** – Defined (implementation private)  
- **Public Documentation** – [`MANIFESTO.md`](./MANIFESTO.md) available for reference  
- **Benchmarking** – Completed in controlled environments  
- **Implementation** – Internal builds operational, private codebase maintained

## Contributions

The SIM‑ONE Framework is an open philosophical and architectural standard.  
We welcome discussions, critiques, and conceptual contributions that advance governed cognition as a field.
