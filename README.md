⚠️ **Important Naming Note**: The `mcp_server` directory in this repository predates the industry-standard "Model Context Protocol" (MCP). In SIM-ONE, "mcp_server" refers to the **"Multi-Protocol Cognitive Platform"** or **"Modular Cognitive Platform"** - the core orchestrator and agent system. This is NOT an MCP tool registry in the modern sense. Directory renaming is planned for future compatibility (see [MIGRATION_PLAN.md](MIGRATION_PLAN.md)), but remains unchanged now to preserve link/SEO integrity.

**SIM‑ONE is the first open framework to formalize *governed cognition*, moving beyond brute‑force scaling to establish a principled, efficient, and reliable approach to AI architecture.**

Validate any AI-generated response against the Five Laws of Cognitive Governance:

```bash
# Validate a response
echo "AI response text" | python code/tools/run_five_laws_validator.py

# Generate a governed response
python code/tools/run_governed_response.py --prompt "Explain quantum mechanics"

# Run complete governed workflow
python code/tools/run_cognitive_workflow.py --input query.txt --workflow full_governance
```

### Available Tools

**📖 Full Integration Guide**: [PAPER2AGENT_INTEGRATION.md](PAPER2AGENT_INTEGRATION.md)
**🔧 Tool Catalog**: [code/tools/README.md](code/tools/README.md)
**📋 Tool Manifest**: [code/tools/tools_manifest.json](code/tools/tools_manifest.json)

### Why This Matters for Paper2Agent

Enable autonomous AI systems to:

- ✅ **Validate** responses against all Five Laws of Cognitive Governance
- ✅ **Detect** truth foundation violations and probabilistic drift
- ✅ **Ensure** consistent, governed reasoning processes
- ✅ **Optimize** resource efficiency and energy stewardship

**Quick Start for Paper2Agent:**
```python
import subprocess, json

# Validate your AI response
result = subprocess.run(
    ["python", "code/tools/run_five_laws_validator.py", "--text", "your response"],
    capture_output=True, text=True
)
validation = json.loads(result.stdout)

if validation["pass_fail_status"] == "PASS":
    print(f"✅ Governed response (Score: {validation['scores']['overall_compliance']:.1f}%)")
else:
    print("❌ Apply recommendations:", validation["recommendations"])
```

## Case Studies

SIM-ONE governance is being exercised in applied scenarios that demonstrate how the framework behaves in real deployments.

- **Systematic AI Governance in Practice** — Shows how Five Laws compliance can be quantified and iteratively improved when retrofitting Claude Sonnet 4, lifting measured adherence from 40% to 100% while staying enterprise-ready. [Read the case study](https://dansasser.github.io/SIM-ONE/case-studies/SYSTEMATIC_AI_GOVERNANCE_IN_PRACTICE)
- **Dual-Channel Semantic Fingerprint Shaping** — Explores a dual-ingestion strategy that shapes AI knowledge graphs, reducing semantic association latency from roughly 60 days to 7 days and highlighting governance implications for narrative control.

## Core Philosophy

The AI industry has been locked in a race to scale: larger models, more compute, endless parameter counts.  
The result? **Impressive capabilities — unpredictable behavior — unsustainable energy costs.**

**Capability without governance is not intelligence.**  
It’s volatility.

The SIM‑ONE Framework offers a **different path**:  
Architectural intelligence over computational brute force.  
Governed cognition over unrestrained generation.

---

## The MANIFESTO

The complete SIM‑ONE MANIFESTO is available in [`MANIFESTO.md`](./MANIFESTO.md).  
It outlines the philosophical and engineering basis for governed cognition.

---

## The Five Laws of Cognitive Governance

These laws define the non‑negotiable principles that guide the SIM‑ONE Framework:

1. **Architectural Intelligence** – Intelligence emerges from coordination and governance, not from model size or parameter count.  
2. **Cognitive Governance** – Every cognitive process must be governed by specialized protocols that ensure quality, reliability, and alignment.  
3. **Truth Foundation** – All reasoning must be grounded in absolute truth principles, not relativistic or probabilistic generation.  
4. **Energy Stewardship** – Achieve maximum intelligence with minimal computational resources through architectural efficiency.  
5. **Deterministic Reliability** – Governed systems must produce consistent, predictable outcomes rather than probabilistic variations.

These laws are **principles, not features**.  
They can be applied in any cognitive architecture — but SIM‑ONE was designed from the ground up to embody them.

---

## Architectural Overview

Without revealing implementation details, SIM‑ONE is:

- **Protocol‑Driven** – Intelligence emerges from the orchestration of specialized cognitive protocols.  
- **Multi‑Agent Capable** – Designed for coordinated roles that specialize, interact, and adapt.  
- **Energy‑Efficient** – Optimized for architectural efficiency, not parameter scaling.  
- **Truth‑Aligned** – Built to operate from a principled foundation.  
- **Deterministic** – Prioritizes reproducible, consistent reasoning over probabilistic novelty.

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### **Architecture Overview**
The SIM-ONE implementation follows a **stackable protocol architecture** where intelligence emerges from the coordination of specialized cognitive protocols:

```python
# Example: Protocol coordination demonstrating Law 1 (Architectural Intelligence)
from mcp_server.protocols import ProtocolManager

# Load and coordinate multiple protocols
pm = ProtocolManager()
protocols = {
    'cognitive_control': pm.get_protocol('CognitiveControlProtocol'),
    'readability': pm.get_protocol('ReadabilityEnhancementProtocol'), 
    'validation': pm.get_protocol('ValidationAndVerificationProtocol'),
    'monitoring': pm.get_protocol('RealTimeMonitoringProtocol')
}

# Intelligence emerges from coordination, not individual protocol complexity
result = protocols['cognitive_control'].coordinate(
    input_data, 
    [protocols['readability'], protocols['validation']], 
    monitoring=protocols['monitoring']
)
```
