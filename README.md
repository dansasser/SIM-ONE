**SIM-ONE is the first open framework to formalize governed cognition, moving beyond brute-force scaling to establish a new standard for building trustworthy, efficient, and auditable AI systems.**

This repository contains the official manifesto, technical papers, and architectural principles for the SIM-ONE Framework.

## The Core Thesis: Architecture > Scale

The current paradigm of AI development is dominated by a race to scale. The prevailing belief is that larger models, trained on more data, will eventually lead to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). We believe this approach is fundamentally flawed. Capability without governance is not intelligence—it’s volatility.

The SIM-ONE Framework proposes a radical alternative: a governed, modular cognitive architecture where structure, principles, and protocols matter more than parameter count.

## The Manifesto

*The following is the complete and official manifesto for the SIM-ONE project.*

### 1. The Wrong Debate

Everyone’s asking how to build AGI. Almost no one’s asking what it is. We’ve been racing toward human-level intelligence with tools that can summarize, generate, and predict. The result? A thousand demos and no architecture. A thousand outputs and no cognitive integrity. At some point, we have to stop the sprint and ask a structural question: What does an intelligent system have to be in order to qualify as general intelligence?

### 2. Why Definition Is the First Battlefield

A system that lacks a definition of cognition cannot produce it—only mimic its effects. In a governed system, definition is architecture. That’s why Sim-One begins with an architectural axiom: **“Cognition is the brain’s recursive process of transforming sensory input into prioritized meaning.”** This provides a stable, falsifiable engineering target for a synthetic system.

### 3. The Five Laws of Cognitive Governance

You can’t build AGI on vibes. AGI without cognitive laws is like a society without rules: impressive, unpredictable, and always one step from collapse. SIM-ONE introduces five laws as non-negotiable structural requirements.

* **Law 1: Structural Priority:** Strategic planning must outrank short-term action. The system must have a Planner, an Executor, and a Verifier.
* **Law 2: Recursive Validation:** Every output must be evaluated against its originating intent in a recursive feedback loop to prevent hallucination.
* **Law 3: Ethical Alignment:** No plan can execute without ethical validation from a non-overridable Ethical Control Protocol (ECP).
* **Law 4: Experiential Memory:** The agent must remember with weight and meaning, tagging memories with computationally-derived salience scores.
* **Law 5: Protocolic Governance:** All functions must follow formal, machine-readable protocols. Prompting is not governance.

### 4. The Framework Is the Proof

SIM-ONE is the first full-stack protocol framework built to obey these cognitive laws from the ground up. It leverages language models as a linguistic generation engine but subordinates them to a superior cognitive and ethical governance structure. The LLM produces the words; the SIM-ONE framework ensures those words have integrity.

## Architectural Components

The framework is composed of modular agents and protocol layers that work in sync:

* **The Planner:** Sets strategic intent.
* **The Executor (MVLM):** A Minimum Viable Language Model that generates actionable output.
* **The Verifier:** Checks for alignment and integrity.
* **The ECP:** Enforces ethical compliance before execution.
* **Protocols (HIP, POCP, REP):** Govern specific tasks like hyperlink interpretation and punctuation.
* **ESL (Emotional Salience Layer):** The functional layer that assigns significance to feedback, achieved through the interaction of the Critic, the Protocols, and Experiential Memory.
* **MCP (Multi-Agent Cognitive Processor):** The architectural pattern that coordinates the flow between agents.

## Project Status

This project is currently in the public release phase. The core philosophical documents are complete, and the first production-grade implementation (The Multi-Agent Creative Writing Server) is operational and has been successfully benchmarked.
