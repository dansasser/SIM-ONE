# Logging and Auditing System Design

This document outlines the design of the Logging and Auditing System for the mCP Server.

## 1. Overview

The Logging and Auditing System is a centralized component responsible for collecting, storing, and providing access to log data from all parts of the mCP Server. A robust logging system is essential for traceability, debugging, security, and ensuring compliance with the principles of the SIM-ONE framework.

## 2. Log Structure

To ensure consistency and to make the logs easy to parse and analyze, all log messages will follow a standardized JSON format.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-07T15:35:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "component": "OrchestrationEngine",
  "task_id": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479",
  "protocol": "ReadabilityEnhancementProtocol",
  "message": "Protocol executed successfully.",
  "duration_ms": 120
}
```

*   `timestamp`: The time the event occurred.
*   `level`: The log level (see below).
*   `component`: The component that generated the log message (e.g., `OrchestrationEngine`, `APIGateway`).
*   `task_id`: The ID of the task associated with the event.
*   `protocol`: The name of the protocol associated with the event (if any).
*   `message`: The log message.
*   `duration_ms`: The duration of the operation, if applicable.

## 3. Log Levels

The system will use the following standard log levels:

*   `DEBUG`: Detailed information for debugging purposes.
*   `INFO`: General information about the system's operation.
*   `WARN`: Indicates a potential problem.
*   `ERROR`: An error has occurred.
*   `FATAL`: A critical error that may cause the system to shut down.

The log level will be configurable for each component.

## 4. Log Aggregation

Logs from the different components of the mCP Server will be sent to a centralized log aggregation service. This service will be responsible for:

*   Collecting logs from all sources.
*   Parsing and indexing the logs.
*   Storing the logs in a searchable, long-term storage solution (e.g., Elasticsearch, Loki, or a cloud-based logging service).

This approach decouples the logging from the application components and makes it easier to manage and analyze the logs.

## 5. Audit Trail

In addition to general logging, the system will record a specific set of events to create a detailed audit trail. This is crucial for security and compliance. The following events will be audited:

*   **API Requests:** Every request to the API Gateway will be logged, including the client's IP address, the authenticated user, the requested endpoint, and the request parameters.
*   **Task Lifecycle:** The creation, start, completion, and failure of every task will be logged.
*   **Protocol Execution:** The start and end of each protocol execution will be logged, including the input and output data (or a hash of the data, for privacy).
*   **Configuration Changes:** Any changes to the server's configuration will be logged.
*   **User Management:** Any changes to user accounts or permissions will be logged.

## 6. Log Analysis and Monitoring

The aggregated logs will be used for:

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Dashboards will be created to visualize the health and performance of the system in real-time.
*   **Alerting:** Alerts will be configured to notify the operations team of any critical errors or security events.
*   **Forensic Analysis:** The audit trail will be used to investigate security incidents and to understand the sequence of events that led to a particular outcome.
*   **Performance Optimization:** The logs will be analyzed to identify performance bottlenecks and to optimize the system's resource usage.

By implementing this comprehensive logging and auditing system, we can ensure that the mCP Server is transparent, accountable, and easy to operate.
