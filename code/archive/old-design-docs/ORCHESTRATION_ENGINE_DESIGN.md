# Orchestration Engine Design

This document outlines the design of the Orchestration Engine for the mCP Server.

## 1. Overview

The Orchestration Engine is the core component of the mCP Server. It is responsible for managing the execution of cognitive tasks, which involves orchestrating the execution of a series of cognitive protocols.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

*   **Task Management:** Receive and manage the lifecycle of cognitive tasks from the API Gateway.
*   **Workflow Definition:** Define and manage cognitive workflows, which are sequences of protocols.
*   **Protocol Orchestration:** Execute the protocols in a workflow according to a specified coordination mode.
*   **State Management:** Track the state of each task and workflow.
*   **Error Handling:** Handle errors and failures gracefully.

## 3. Task Management

The Orchestration Engine will receive tasks from the API Gateway. Each task will be represented by a `Task` object, which will contain the following information:

*   `task_id`: A unique identifier for the task.
*   `workflow_id`: The identifier of the workflow to be executed.
*   `input_data`: The input data for the task.
*   `status`: The current status of the task (e.g., `pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`).
*   `result`: The result of the task.

The engine will maintain a queue of pending tasks and will execute them based on their priority and the availability of resources.

## 4. Workflow Execution

A workflow is a sequence of protocols that are executed to complete a cognitive task. The Orchestration Engine will use a workflow definition to determine which protocols to execute and in what order.

The engine will interact with the Protocol Manager to get instances of the required protocols. It will then execute the protocols, passing the output of one protocol as the input to the next.

## 5. Coordination Modes

The Orchestration Engine will support the four coordination modes defined in the `CCP_PROTOCOL.md`:

### 5.1. Sequential Governance

This is the simplest coordination mode. Protocols are executed one after another, in a predefined order. The output of each protocol is passed as the input to the next.

**Implementation:** A simple chain of function calls or a state machine.

### 5.2. Parallel Governance

In this mode, multiple protocols can be executed concurrently. This is useful for tasks that can be broken down into independent sub-tasks.

**Implementation:** The engine will use a thread pool or an asynchronous task execution framework (like `asyncio` in Python or `CompletableFuture` in Java) to execute the protocols in parallel. The engine will need to handle the synchronization of the results before proceeding to the next step in the workflow.

### 5.3. Hierarchical Governance

This mode involves a multi-tiered structure where some protocols can supervise the execution of other protocols. This allows for more complex and fine-grained control over the workflow.

**Implementation:** The workflow definition will be a tree-like structure. The Orchestration Engine will traverse the tree, executing the protocols at each level. The supervising protocols will receive the output of the supervised protocols and can make decisions based on it.

### 5.4. Adaptive Governance

This is the most advanced coordination mode. The engine can dynamically adjust the workflow based on the context and the results of the protocols that have already been executed.

**Implementation:** The engine will use a rules engine or a state machine with conditional transitions. The rules will be defined in the workflow definition and will determine which protocol to execute next based on the current state of the workflow and the output of the previous protocols.

## 6. State Management

The Orchestration Engine will need to maintain the state of each task and workflow. This includes:

*   The current status of the task.
*   The output of each protocol that has been executed.
*   Any intermediate data that needs to be passed between protocols.

The state will be stored in a persistent data store (e.g., a database or a distributed cache) to ensure that the engine can recover from failures.

## 7. Error Handling and Resilience

The Orchestration Engine must be resilient to failures. It will implement the following error handling mechanisms:

*   **Retries:** The engine will be able to retry failed protocols.
*   **Timeouts:** The engine will enforce timeouts on protocol execution to prevent tasks from getting stuck.
*   **Fallback Protocols:** The workflow definition can specify fallback protocols to be executed if a protocol fails.
*   **Circuit Breakers:** The engine will use circuit breakers to prevent repeated calls to a failing protocol.

By designing the Orchestration Engine with these principles in mind, we can create a robust and flexible platform for executing cognitive workflows.
