## Integration with Jules Work

**Coordination Strategy:**
1. **Jules completes Phase 2** (security, memory enhancement, production config)
2. **Infrastructure team starts Phase 3** (containers, databases, CI/CD)
3. **Parallel development** of advanced features (Phase 4-5)
4. **Integration testing** of combined capabilities

**Handoff Points:**
- Jules delivers enhanced memory system → Infrastructure adds PostgreSQL support
- Jules completes production config → Infrastructure adds container deployment
- Jules implements monitoring → Infrastructure adds enterprise observability

This plan ensures no redundancy while building comprehensive enterprise production readiness on top of Jules' excellent cognitive architecture enhancements.
