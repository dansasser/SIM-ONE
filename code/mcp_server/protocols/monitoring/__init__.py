Phase 5.1: Real-Time Monitoring Protocol

This module implements comprehensive real-time monitoring and compliance stack protocols
for the SIM-ONE Framework, providing real-time oversight, performance tracking, and
compliance reporting across the entire protocol stack.

Protocols included:
- RealTimeMonitorProtocol: Core real-time monitoring capabilities
- SystemHealthMonitor: System resource and health monitoring  
- PerformanceTracker: Protocol performance and metrics tracking
- AlertManager: Intelligent alerting and notification system

Architecture:
Following SIM-ONE's stackable protocol philosophy, all monitoring protocols are
additive and composable without modifying existing protocols.
