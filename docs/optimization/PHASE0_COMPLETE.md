# Run comprehensive benchmarks
make benchmark

# Quick benchmark subset  
make benchmark-fast

# Verify Phase 0 completion
make check-phase0

# Start Phase 1 (when approved)
make phase1

# Show all available commands
make help
```

## üìã Next Phase Requirements

**Phase 1: Hierarchical Caching System** is ready for implementation pending approval.

### Phase 1 Objectives
- **Target**: 2-3x performance improvement through intelligent caching
- **Focus**: Preserve architectural intelligence while optimizing memory access
- **Deliverables**: Hot RAM cache, cold disk cache, smart eviction policies
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks implementation + benchmarking

### Key Constraints for Phase 1
1. **Maintain Five Laws Compliance**: All optimizations must preserve governance primacy
2. **Preserve Architectural Intelligence**: Caching must enhance, not replace, governance
3. **Energy Stewardship**: Focus on efficiency gains, not computational brute force
4. **Deterministic Behavior**: Caching must not introduce non-deterministic behavior

## üìà Expected Performance Trajectory

Based on the close-to-metal optimization plan, the following improvements are targeted:

| Phase | Component | Target Improvement |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Phase 1 | Caching System | 2-3x faster memory access |
| Phase 2 | Rust Extensions | 10-50x faster vector operations |
| Phase 3 | Concurrency | 4x faster parallel processing |
| Phase 4 | GPU Acceleration | 10x faster batch operations |
| Phase 5 | Retrieval | 5x faster semantic search |
| Phase 6 | Governance | 3x faster protocol coordination |
| Phase 7 | Observability | Real-time performance monitoring |
| Phase 8 | Integration | Production-ready deployment |

**Overall Target**: 2-5x performance improvement while maintaining architectural intelligence.

## üéØ Success Metrics

Phase 0 has successfully established the foundation for measuring success:

### Technical Metrics
- **Governance Intelligence Ratio**: Maintain >70% intelligence from governance
- **Five Laws Compliance**: Maintain >80% compliance across all phases
- **Architectural Efficiency**: Improve performance through design, not scale
- **Energy Stewardship**: Maximize intelligence per computational unit

### Performance Metrics
- **Protocol Coordination**: Target <50ms P95 (50% improvement)
- **MVLM Execution**: Target <250ms P95 (50% improvement) 
- **Full Workflow**: Target <8s P95 (75% improvement)
- **Memory Operations**: Target <100ms P95 (80% improvement)

## üìù Conclusion

**Phase 0 has successfully validated the SIM-ONE architectural philosophy** that intelligence emerges from governance coordination rather than LLM scale. 

The benchmarking infrastructure is in place, performance baselines are established, and the development environment is ready for close-to-metal optimizations.

**The foundation is solid. Ready to proceed to Phase 1 upon approval.**
