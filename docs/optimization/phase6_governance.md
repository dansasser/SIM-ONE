# Governance Runtime Optimization

## Overview
Implementation documentation for Governance Runtime Optimization in the SIM-ONE Framework close-to-metal optimization plan.

## Objectives
- Preserve architectural intelligence while optimizing execution performance
- Maintain Five Laws of Cognitive Governance compliance
- Focus on coordination efficiency rather than raw computational power

## Key Metrics
- Intelligence emergence through governance
- Protocol coordination efficiency  
- MVLM execution performance (stateless CPU-like behavior)
- Energy stewardship through architectural design

## Implementation Status
- [ ] Planning complete
- [ ] Implementation started
- [ ] Benchmarks integrated
- [ ] Five Laws compliance verified
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Ready for next phase

## Results
*Results will be documented here during implementation*

## Next Steps
*Next steps will be identified during implementation*
