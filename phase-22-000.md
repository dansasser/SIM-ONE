## **1. Keep Current Directory (mcp_server) For Now**

- Don‚Äôt rename the directory immediately; it‚Äôs critical for not breaking existing URLs, documentation, or integrations.
- Keep the ‚Äúmcp_server‚Äù name while it‚Äôs in active, public/shared use.

***

## **2. Add Clear Explanation in README and Key Docs**

- At the top of your `README.md` and `/code/mcp_server/README.md`, **add a bold note**:
    ```
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The `mcp_server` directory predates the industry-standard ‚ÄúModel Context Protocol.‚Äù In this repo, ‚Äúmcp_server‚Äù means ‚Äúmulti-protocol agentic system (or modular cognitive platform).‚Äù It is the orchestrator and agent core‚Äînot just a modern ‚ÄúMCP tool registry.‚Äù Renaming is planned for future compatibility, but directory is unchanged to preserve link/AEO integrity.
    ```

***

## **3. Prepare for Future Rename (Soft Deprecate Old Name)**
- **Create a migration plan**:
   - Internally, start referring to the replacement name in docstrings, comments, new docs (‚Äúagent_core/‚Äù, ‚Äúcognitive_orchestrator/‚Äù, etc.).
- **When you are ready to rename:**
   - Move `mcp_server` to e.g., `agent_core/` in a new main branch/version (v2+).
   - Leave a `mcp_server/` folder as a *symlink* (if possible) to new dir, or a README with explanation:
     ```
     This directory has moved to /agent_core/.
     All links will be maintained for legacy shared/SEO access.
     ```
   - Use `git mv` or a scripted rename for open-source tracking.
- **If you control deployment/docs:**  
   - Update URLs, TOCs, and navigation for new/existing users, but keep forwarding or anchor docs for the old name until search/AEO/clients have caught up (could be 3-6 months).

***

## **4. Preserve/Redirect Links (Where Possible)**
- GitHub doesn‚Äôt support automatic soft redirects for renamed folders, but you can:
   - Leave a stub/README in `/mcp_server/` pointing to `/agent_core/` or `/cognitive_orchestrator/`.
   - In web docs/blogs, use canonical links or HTML meta-ref redirects for key content.
   - Update ecosystem package indexes (PyPI, Docker Hub, etc.) to reflect the new name when you‚Äôre ready.

***

## **5. Announce, Document, Archive**
- **Announce the rename** in:
   - Project changelogs
   - Key README docs and update guides
   - Social channels (Twitter, LinkedIn), blog posts if relevant
- **Archive historic ‚Äúmcp_server‚Äù usage** in a migration doc (explain the rationale‚Äîindustry standard convergence, clarity, etc.).

***

## **6. Update Internal and Future-Facing Code/Docs**
- For all NEW contributions, use the new preferred naming in:
   - Code comments, function/class docstrings, workflow demos

***

## ***New folder name:**  
   - `agent_core`  
- **Be explicit about the architecture (‚Äúagent‚Äù, ‚Äúorchestrator‚Äù, ‚Äúgovernance‚Äù):** that helps future search, ecosystem, and contributors.

## **Summary Table**

| Step                        | What to do/How to signal                  |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Keep current dir            | Don‚Äôt break links until ready             |
| Explain everywhere          | Add bold notice in README, docs           |
| Prepare rename              | Migrate internally, announce & document   |
| Redirect/forward links      | README pointer in old directory           |
| Announce and archive        | Changelogs, blogs, project update notes   |
| Use new names in new code   | Phase in ‚Äúagent_core‚Äù (or similar) now    |

***

**This lets you support current users/search, avoid confusion for new ones, and smoothly upgrade the project over time‚Äîwithout breaking your AEO, collaborations, or community integrations.**

### **Transition Plan for Renaming `mcp_server` Directory**

1. **Do NOT rename immediately.**  
   Keep `mcp_server` as-is in main/master for now to preserve:
   - All shared URLs (GitHub, docs, search engines)
   - Backward compatibility for collaborators and integrations

2. **Add a prominent note in your README and `/code/mcp_server/README.md`:**
   > **Note: ‚Äúmcp_server‚Äù here refers to our historic ‚Äúmodular cognitive platform‚Äù‚Äîthe full agentic orchestrator. We plan to update naming for standard clarity, but links are retained for now for stability, SEO, and user continuity.**

3. **Prepare your new name in background:**
   - Pick a futureproof term (e.g., `agent_core`, `orchestrator`, `governance_brain`, etc.)
   - Start using that internally in new code, docstrings, and new tutorial docs.
   - Optionally, mirror directory structure‚Äîkeep both `mcp_server/` and `agent_core/` in a dev branch for initial migration.
   
4. **When you‚Äôre ready to rename publicly:**
   - Move contents to the new folder in a major version/branch bump (`v2` or similar).
   - Leave a `mcp_server/` directory with only a README:
     > This directory has moved to `/agent_core/` ([link]). All legacy links are maintained for search/discoverability. Please update bookmarks as development migrates.
   - In web documentation, set canonical element or a redirect to prioritize the new path in search engines.

5. **Signal widely:**
   - Announce rename in GitHub releases, changelog, and community channels (Twitter, LinkedIn, mailing list, etc.)
   - Highlight rationale: aligning with evolving AI/LLM/agentic ecosystem standards.

6. **Monitor AEO/SEO:**
   - Search your current links in Google/Bing and note top-ranking pages.
   - Keep the old directory/index file around for at least 6‚Äì12 months (or longer if you have heavy traffic).

***

**Short version:**  
- Add a visible note now.
- Build out the new organization behind the scenes.
- When you do change, leave a prominent marker (README) in the old directory for continuity.
- Announce clearly to users and search engines.

Let me know if you need example README boilerplate or further advice for specific indexation/migration tools!

## **Practical Guide: Making SIM-ONE Paper2Agent-Friendly (Tool-Indexable)**

### **1. Add ‚ÄúWrappers‚Äù or CLI Entrypoints for Each Protocol**

**Goal:** Give Paper2Agent clear Python files that act as ‚Äúcallable tools‚Äù for each protocol you want indexed.

**How:**  
- For each major protocol/class, create a file in `/code/tools/` (or top-level `/tools/`) named for the protocol, e.g.:
  - `run_sep_tool.py`
  - `run_ccp_tool.py`
  - `run_rep_tool.py`

**Sample wrapper for SEP:**
```python
# run_sep_tool.py
from code.mcp_server.protocols.sep.semantic_encoding_protocol import SemanticEncodingProtocol
import sys
import asyncio

def main():
    sep = SemanticEncodingProtocol()
    text = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else input("Enter text: ")
    result = asyncio.run(sep.encode_text(text))
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
- Repeat for other protocols (REP, CCP, VVP, etc.), calling their main method for a demo input.

***

### **2. Docstrings and Metadata**

**Goal:** Some extractors also look for function/class docstrings with clear "tool" or "entrypoint" markers.

- Ensure your wrappers have:
  - A top-of-file docstring:  
    ```python
    """
    Tool: Run the SEP Protocol
    Input: Text string
    Output: Semantic encoding vector and meta
    """
    ```
  - Optionally standardize with a tag/comment like `# MCP_TOOL_ENTRYPOINT`

***

### **3. Index/Discovery File (Optional but Useful)**

**Goal:** Help Paper2Agent ‚Äúsee‚Äù everything.

- Make a `tools_manifest.py` or `paper2agent_index.md` listing every protocol/tool and its wrapper.
    ```
    SEP: run_sep_tool.py
    REP: run_rep_tool.py
    CCP: run_ccp_tool.py
    ...
    ```
- Some frameworks will auto-index from such a manifest.

***

### **4. Documentation Update (for Paper2Agent Extraction)**

- Add a short section in your main README or in `/case-studies/`:
    ```
    # üõ†Ô∏è Tool Entrypoints for Extraction
    Each major protocol is exposed as a CLI/standalone tool in `/tools/`.
    These wrappers are for agentizing and auto-tool-indexing.
    ```
- Clearly map each protocol to their respective wrapper script.

***

### **5. (If Needed) ‚ÄúFlatten‚Äù Dataset/Workflow Demos**

- For any multi-step methods or pipeline demos (not just single protocols), make wrappers that run those as ‚Äúone-click‚Äù scripts, too.
- Name and describe them for Paper2Agent as above.

***

### **6. Run Paper2Agent Again**

- Make sure it targets the repo root.
- It should now recognize a whole suite of simple entrypoint scripts as ‚Äútools,‚Äù and treat your actual protocols as discoverable/agentizable.

***

## **Key Notes:**
- **NO NEED to rewrite or refactor your orchestrator/architecture.**
- These wrappers are *adapters* for tooling and auto-indexers‚Äîyour real system remains clean.
- Later, when MCP terminology is fixed in your repo, you can extend this to direct API/agent integration without breaking backward compatibility.
