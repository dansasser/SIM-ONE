## 🧠 What Is REP?

**REP** is a deterministic, modular protocol for improving the **readability and stylistic quality** of AI-generated text. It acts as a programmable editor—enforcing sentence rhythm, active voice, cohesion, and conciseness—without relying on vague prompts or post-hoc fine-tuning.

It is part of a larger ecosystem of protocols that structure AI behavior across reasoning (HIP), style (REP), and formatting (POCP).

## 📦 Use Cases

✅ Blog and article polishing  
✅ UX copy optimization  
✅ E-learning content refinement  
✅ Chatbot tone consistency  
✅ Post-processing LLM output in any structured agent stack

## ⚙️ Protocol Modules

REP is composed of four sequenced modules:

1. **Sentence Rhythm & Variety**  
2. **Voice & Phrasing**  
3. **Flow & Cohesion**  
4. **Clarity & Conciseness**

Each module is configurable via a JSON object. The system also supports logging and guardrails for safe editing.

## 📐 Recommended Integration

For optimal results, integrate REP in this order:

```plaintext
LLM Output → REP → POCP → Final Output
```
This ensures REP performs major stylistic rewrites before punctuation and formatting are locked in by POCP.
