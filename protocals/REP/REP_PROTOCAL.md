# Readability Enhancement Protocol (REP) v1.3

> **Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate text that is grammatically correct but stylistically monotonous, robotic, or overly complex. The Readability Enhancement Protocol (REP) provides a standardized, open-source framework for AI agents to programmatically analyze and refine generated text, enforcing characteristics of human-like writing such as rhythmic variation, active voice, and logical flow.

## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

**Version:** 1.3   
**Status:** Final   
**Author:** Daniel T. Sasser II   
**Project:** Gorombo Agent Framework

---

## <a name="purpose"></a>Purpose

The Readability Enhancement Protocol (REP) is designed to be a modular, deterministic post-processing layer that operates on text generated by an AI agent. Instead of relying on fallible instructions within a prompt, REP applies a configurable set of rules to automatically improve the stylistic quality of the output. It acts as an automated style and copy editor, ensuring the final text is not only correct but also engaging and readable.

---

## <a name="use-cases"></a>Use Cases

REP is designed for any workflow where the final quality of the AI-generated text is critical.

✅ **Content Creation:** Automatically improving the flow and readability of first drafts of articles, reports, or creative writing.
✅ **Conversational AI:** Making chatbot responses sound less robotic and more natural.
✅ **Technical Documentation:** Clarifying complex sequences and improving the scannability of technical guides.
✅ **E-learning Scripts:** Improving student comprehension by ensuring clarity and an engaging rhythm.
✅ **Mobile UI Content:** Enforcing brevity and a consistent tone for user interface text.
✅ **Enforcing a Style Guide:** Programmatically ensuring all generated content adheres to specific stylistic rules.

## <a name="sequencing"></a>Module Sequencing Rationale

The protocol's modules are designed to be run in a specific logical order to ensure efficiency and prevent conflicting edits. The sequence proceeds from broad, structural changes to fine-grained, word-level changes.

1.  **Sentence Rhythm & Variety:** This runs first because it can make significant structural changes, such as splitting or combining sentences. It's inefficient to perform word-level edits on sentences that might be completely rewritten.
2.  **Voice & Phrasing:** Once the sentence structure is set, this module adjusts the core voice (e.g., active vs. passive).
3.  **Flow & Cohesion:** This module operates on the now-stable sentence and voice structure to improve connections between ideas.
4.  **Clarity & Conciseness:** This is the final pass, cleaning up filler words from the finalized sentences.

## <a name="structure"></a>Protocol Structure & Logic

The protocol is composed of four primary modules. These modules are designed to be configured and run in the sequence described above.

### <a name="rhythm"></a>1. Sentence Rhythm & Variety
* **Logic:** This module parses the text into sentences and analyzes their word count to prevent monotony.
* **Rule:** It identifies when a configurable number of consecutive sentences (e.g., 3) have a word count within a narrow variance (e.g., ±2 words), indicating rhythmic monotony. This range can be overridden in the configuration.
* **Action:** When triggered, it will attempt to rewrite the section by either combining two short sentences or splitting one long sentence.

### <a name="voice"></a>2. Voice & Phrasing
* **Logic:** This module refines the text's voice to be more active, direct, and appropriately formal.
* **Configuration:** It is controlled by a configuration object that can manage formality (use of contractions) and enforce active voice.

### <a name="flow"></a>3. Flow & Cohesion
* **Logic:** This module improves the logical connection between ideas.
* **Rules:** It analyzes word repetition at both paragraph and document levels against configurable thresholds and can check for the presence of appropriate transition words.

### <a name="clarity"></a>4. Clarity & Conciseness
* **Logic:** This module removes and replaces common filler words and phrases.
* **Guardrails:** This module can be configured with contextual_guardrails to bypass rewrites within quoted dialogue or other sensitive text to avoid over-editing.

## <a name="in-action"></a>REP in Action: A Practical Example

To illustrate the protocol's impact, consider the following before-and-after example.

**Before REP:**
> Due to the fact that the server was down, the team couldn't finish the work. The data was not accessible. The deadline was missed by the team. The project was delayed.

**After REP (medium intensity):**
> Because the server was down, the team couldn't finish the work. The data wasn't accessible, and the team missed the deadline, which delayed the project.

## <a name="configuration"></a>Configuration & Usage

REP is controlled by a JSON object that allows for both global and modular control.

**Example Template: rep-rules-casual-blog.json**
```json
{
  "rep_version": "1.3",
  "global_intensity": "medium",
  "logging": "enabled",
  "modules": {
    "sentence_rhythm": {
      "enabled": true,
      "trigger_count": 3,
      "allowed_variance": 2
    },
    "voice_phrasing": {
      "enabled": true,
      "formality": "casual",
      "clarity_enforcement": "rewrite"
    },
    "flow_cohesion": {
      "enabled": true,
      "repetition_scope": "document",
      "repetition_threshold": 5
    },
    "clarity_conciseness": {
      "enabled": true,
      "contextual_guardrails": true
    }
  }
}
```
<a name="logging"></a>Log Output Schema
When "logging": "enabled", the protocol can be configured to return an array of log objects detailing the changes it made.
Example Log Output:
```json
[
  {
    "module": "clarity_conciseness",
    "action": "replace",
    "original": "Due to the fact that",
    "replacement": "Because",
    "location": "paragraph 1, sentence 1"
  },
  {
    "module": "voice_phrasing",
    "action": "convert_to_active",
    "original": "The deadline was missed by the team",
    "replacement": "the team missed the deadline",
    "location": "paragraph 1, sentence 3"
  }
]
```
<a name="intensity"></a>Defined Intensity Mechanism
The global_intensity setting (low, medium, high) provides a simple way to tune the protocol's overall aggressiveness. This setting modulates the internal thresholds of each module.
 * low: The protocol is less aggressive. It might require 5 consecutive similar sentences to trigger the Rhythm module.
 * medium: The default setting, using the standard values (e.g., 3 sentences for Rhythm).
 * high: The protocol is more aggressive. It might trigger after only 2 similar sentences and use a more extensive list of filler phrases to remove.
<a name="interoperability"></a>Interoperability and Chaining
For best results, REP should be run before a punctuation-focused protocol like POCP.
 * Recommended Order: Agent Output -> REP -> POCP -> Final Text
 * Rationale: REP may alter sentence structure (e.g., splitting a sentence). POCP should be the final step to ensure punctuation is applied correctly to the near-final sentence structures.
<a name="future"></a>Future Directions
The modular design of REP allows for future expansion. Potential v2.0 features could include:
 * A/B Testing Module: A feature to test REP-processed text against the original using readability scores.
 * Persona Sensitivity: Allowing REP to adjust its rules based on a target audience profile (e.g., age, literacy level).
 * Knowledge Preservation: A hook to ensure that fact-based statements are not inadvertently altered during stylistic rewrites.
