# MTP Protocol — Memory Tagger Protocol

## Overview

The **Memory Tagger Protocol (MTP)** is the SIM‑ONE Framework’s governed memory management layer.
It provides persistent, structured, and context‑aware memory capabilities — enabling the system to retain relevant knowledge, recall it deterministically, and apply it within governed cognition workflows.

MTP ensures that memory within SIM‑ONE is **intentional, auditable, and context‑preserving**, supporting long‑term learning and situational awareness.

## Key Functions

* **Memory Tagging** — Applies structured, multi‑dimensional tags to all stored memories for efficient recall.
* **Context Preservation** — Maintains contextual and temporal links between related memories.
* **Emotional Context Integration** — Works with ESL to store emotional salience alongside factual information.
* **Memory Retrieval Governance** — Ensures memory recall aligns with current task requirements and governance rules.
* **Efficiency Preservation** — Provides long‑term memory capabilities with minimal computational overhead.

## Governance Role in SIM‑ONE

MTP supports the **Five Laws of Cognitive Governance** by:

1. Enabling intelligence that builds upon previous governed experiences.
2. Ensuring memory recall is relevant, reliable, and consistent.
3. Preserving important emotional and contextual cues for future reasoning.
4. Providing an auditable structure for all retained knowledge.

## Memory Governance Modes

MTP supports multiple high‑level governance modes:

* **Episodic Memory** — Stores contextual records of events and interactions.
* **Semantic Memory** — Maintains structured knowledge and factual information.
* **Procedural Memory** — Records learned processes and task sequences.
* **Emotional Memory** — Stores emotionally weighted experiences for contextual recall.

---

## Memory Oversight

MTP governs:

* **Memory Classification** — Assigns each memory to the correct category for optimized retrieval.
* **Relationship Mapping** — Links related memories through logical, temporal, and contextual associations.
* **Consolidation Governance** — Determines which memories to retain long‑term and which to archive.
* **Selective Forgetting** — Discards non‑essential or outdated memories to preserve efficiency.

---

## Integration within SIM‑ONE

MTP serves as the **governed knowledge backbone**:

* Works with CCP to coordinate when and how memory is stored or retrieved.
* Integrates with REP to recall relevant reasoning patterns for current tasks.
* Collaborates with VVP to preserve validated reference material for future use.

## Benefits in Governed Cognition

* **Contextual Continuity** — Maintains coherence across long‑term workflows.
* **Learning Capability** — Improves performance through experience‑based refinement.
* **Deterministic Recall** — Ensures consistent retrieval of the same governed memory under identical conditions.
* **Efficiency** — Avoids unnecessary memory accumulation through selective governance.
