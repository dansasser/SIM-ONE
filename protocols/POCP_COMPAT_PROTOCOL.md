# POCP‑Compat Protocol — Punctuation and Orthography Control Protocol (Compatibility Layer)

## Overview

The **Punctuation and Orthography Control Protocol — Compatibility Layer (POCP‑Compat)** is the SIM‑ONE Framework’s governed formatting and presentation layer.
It standardizes punctuation, spelling, and orthography across outputs to ensure professional, accessible, and consistent presentation in all contexts — while remaining compatible with a wide range of legacy and modern systems.

POCP‑Compat enforces uniformity without erasing authorial intent, ensuring that presentation quality remains as predictable and auditable as reasoning quality.

## Key Functions

* **Punctuation Governance** — Enforces consistent and rule‑aligned punctuation across all governed outputs.
* **Orthographic Standardization** — Normalizes spelling, capitalization, and style according to configured standards.
* **Style Harmonization** — Aligns formatting and presentation across the system.
* **Compatibility Assurance** — Ensures formatting works across target platforms and document types.
* **Efficiency Preservation** — Achieves governance‑grade formatting with minimal processing overhead.

## Governance Role in SIM‑ONE

POCP‑Compat supports the **Five Laws of Cognitive Governance** by:

1. Ensuring presentation quality matches cognitive and factual integrity.
2. Providing deterministic formatting rules that yield reproducible results.
3. Preserving accessibility and compatibility without sacrificing clarity.
4. Maintaining an auditable trail of formatting decisions for consistency verification.

## Formatting Governance Modes

POCP‑Compat supports multiple high‑level governance modes:

* **Professional** — Strict, consistent, and standards‑driven formatting.
* **Academic** — Formal and citation‑friendly presentation.
* **Creative** — Flexible formatting with stylistic variation.
* **Custom Governance** — Organization‑specific formatting rules.

---

## Formatting Oversight

POCP‑Compat governs:

* **Punctuation Consistency** — Commas, quotation marks, dashes, hyphenation, and ellipses usage.
* **Capitalization Rules** — Proper nouns, acronyms, title case, and sentence starts.
* **Spacing Integrity** — Word, punctuation, and paragraph spacing.
* **Orthographic Preference** — U.S., U.K., or custom spelling conventions.

## Integration within SIM‑ONE

POCP‑Compat acts as a **final presentation quality gate**:

* Works with CCP to ensure formatting is applied in the correct execution stage.
* Cooperates with REP and VVP to ensure reasoning and validation are reflected clearly in output presentation.
* Preserves consistent presentation across agents and workflows.

## Benefits in Governed Cognition

* **Brand & Voice Consistency** — Uniform presentation reinforces organizational identity.
* **Accessibility** — Formatting optimized for readability and assistive technologies.
* **Cross‑System Reliability** — Outputs maintain integrity regardless of platform.
* **Predictability** — Formatting results are consistent and repeatable.
