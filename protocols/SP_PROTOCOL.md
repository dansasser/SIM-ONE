# SP Protocol — Summarizer Protocol

## Overview

The **Summarizer Protocol (SP)** is the SIM‑ONE Framework’s governed final‑output layer.
It refines and consolidates the results of all preceding protocols into **clear, coherent, and presentation‑ready responses**.
SP ensures that every output reflects the framework’s standards for **quality, structure, and readability** before delivery.

## Key Functions

* **Final Output Governance** — Transforms intermediate results into polished, audience‑ready responses.
* **Adaptive Summarization** — Generates summaries tailored for comprehensive, concise, or executive‑style delivery.
* **Tone Alignment** — Matches tone to professional, academic, or contextual requirements.
* **Structure Optimization** — Organizes information for clarity and logical flow.
* **Quality Scoring** — Assesses outputs against governance metrics before approval.

## Governance Role in SIM‑ONE

SP supports the **Five Laws of Cognitive Governance** by:

1. Ensuring that the final output communicates governed reasoning effectively.
2. Preserving truth alignment while enhancing clarity.
3. Standardizing presentation for consistent audience experience.
4. Acting as the **final governance checkpoint** before delivery.

## Summarization Governance Modes

SP supports multiple high‑level governance modes:

* **Comprehensive** — Preserves most details while improving structure and readability.
* **Concise** — Focuses on key points for quick understanding.
* **Executive** — Delivers high‑level insights with actionable takeaways.

---

## Output Oversight

SP governs:

* **Clarity** — Ensuring outputs are understandable without losing accuracy.
* **Coherence** — Maintaining logical flow from start to finish.
* **Completeness** — Including all necessary information within the selected summary style.
* **Formatting** — Enforcing governance‑aligned presentation standards.

---

## Integration within SIM‑ONE

SP functions as the **final stage** in the governed cognition pipeline:

* Works with VVP to verify the accuracy and quality of the final content.
* Integrates with POCP‑Compat to ensure formatting and orthography compliance.
* Completes the governance loop by producing the final approved version of the output.

## Benefits in Governed Cognition

* **Professional Consistency** — Every output meets high presentation standards.
* **Audience Adaptability** — Styles and tones tailored to the intended audience.
* **Decision Support** — Executive summaries designed for rapid, informed action.
* **Reliability** — Reproducible, consistent quality across outputs.
