# VVP Protocol — Verification and Validation Protocol

## Overview

The **Verification and Validation Protocol (VVP)** is the SIM‑ONE Framework’s governed quality assurance layer.
It ensures that all cognitive outputs are **accurate, consistent, complete, and aligned** with governance principles before being accepted into the final workflow.

VVP acts as the **quality gate** of SIM‑ONE — no output is considered valid until it passes through its structured verification and validation process.

## Key Functions

* **Factual Verification** — Confirms that statements are accurate against approved sources or validated knowledge.
* **Logical Validation** — Ensures internal consistency and coherence throughout the content.
* **Quality Assessment** — Evaluates clarity, completeness, and adherence to governance standards.
* **Error Detection** — Identifies issues, inconsistencies, or rule violations.
* **Efficiency Preservation** — Delivers high‑confidence validation with minimal computational overhead.

## Governance Role in SIM‑ONE

VVP supports the **Five Laws of Cognitive Governance** by:

1. Enforcing truth‑foundation principles through factual accuracy checks.
2. Preventing the inclusion of illogical or inconsistent reasoning in final outputs.
3. Confirming that all content aligns with established governance standards.
4. Acting as the final safeguard before any cognitive output is accepted as authoritative.

## Validation Governance Modes

VVP supports multiple high‑level governance modes:

* **Basic Validation** — Minimal checks for speed‑sensitive workflows.
* **Comprehensive Validation** — Multi‑dimensional verification for balanced accuracy and efficiency.
* **Expert Validation** — Full depth review with detailed compliance and quality scoring.
* **Domain‑Specific Validation** — Tailored validation for technical, academic, or creative contexts.

---

## Validation Oversight

VVP governs:

* **Factual Accuracy** — Verification against validated knowledge and trusted sources.
* **Logical Consistency** — Step‑by‑step coherence checks.
* **Style & Format Compliance** — Ensures adherence to formatting and presentation standards.
* **Completeness** — Confirms that required elements and information are present.

---

## Integration within SIM‑ONE

VVP operates as the **final review authority**:

* Works with CCP to determine the validation stage within the workflow.
* Collaborates with REP to check the integrity of reasoning and conclusions.
* Coordinates with POCP‑Compat to verify presentation and formatting compliance.

## Benefits in Governed Cognition

* **Reliability** — Only validated outputs progress to deployment or storage.
* **Transparency** — Provides clear, auditable validation reports.
* **Reproducibility** — Consistent validation outcomes under the same conditions.
* **Error Prevention** — Identifies issues before they can impact downstream processes.
