    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use the REP (Reasoning and Explanation Protocol) tool for **advanced multi-modal reasoning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "REP uses the **AdvancedREP** class which provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Five Reasoning Types:\n",
    "1. **Deductive** - Logical inference with modus ponens and modus tollens\n",
    "2. **Inductive** - Pattern recognition and generalization from observations\n",
    "3. **Abductive** - Best explanation inference from observations\n",
    "4. **Analogical** - Similarity-based reasoning\n",
    "5. **Causal** - Cause-effect relationship analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Features:\n",
    "- **Confidence Scoring**: Each conclusion has a confidence level (0.0-1.0)\n",
    "- **Reasoning Chain**: Step-by-step logical progression\n",
    "- **Chain Validation**: Validates logical consistency of reasoning\n",
    "- **Forward Chaining**: Iterative deduction with confidence propagation\n",
    "- **Auto-Detection**: Can automatically select best reasoning type\n"
